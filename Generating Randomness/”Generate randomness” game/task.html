<p>In the final stage, we will gather all our components to construct a game where you will try to beat the system created by your hands. Initially, the player has a virtual capital of $1000. Every time the computer guesses a symbol correctly, the player loses one dollar. Every time the system is wrong, the player gets one dollar.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this final stage, your program should:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Get and preprocess user input just like in stage 1.</li>
	<li>Learn user patterns by collecting triad statistics like in stage 2.</li>
	<li>Ask the user to enter test strings or type <code class="java">enough</code> to exit the game. Each test string must be preprocessed (in order to leave only "0" and "1" symbols). After that, you should launch the prediction algorithm and calculate the number of correctly guessed symbols. After each iteration, you should show the player's balance with the message <code class="java">Your capital is now $X</code>, where <code class="java">X</code> is the player's virtual capital.</li>
	<li>It would be great if you kept updating the system by allowing it to learn from the test data as well. However, this update should happen only after the prediction and the verification stages are done: let's be honest with the user.</li>
	<li>Finish the game with the words <code class="java"><span style="color: #000000;">Game over!</span></code>.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>

You have $1000. Every time the system successfully predicts your next press, you lose $1.
Otherwise, you earn $1. Print "enough" to leave the game. Let's go!

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:
&gt; 0111001001
prediction:
1000101011

Computer guessed right 4 out of 7 symbols (57.14 %)
Your capital is now $999

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:
&gt; some wrong input

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:
&gt; 0101001001
prediction:
0001011011

Computer guessed right 5 out of 7 symbols (71.43 %)
Your capital is now $996

Print a random string containing 0 or 1:
